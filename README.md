# HaskellCoding

This repository contains Haskell programs I wrote as part of my CS252 Advanced Programming Language Principles coursework. I am a big fan of this language for its elegance, conciseness, and consistency. Never knew functional programming could be so much fun (or that I would survive without loops)!
